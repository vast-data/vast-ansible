    This is the canonical mechanism for the case where the API nests a group

    LDAP-delegated fields under ``ldap``) while the user supplies them flat at
    the top level. Configure it declaratively via the ``flatten_subresources``
    schema override.

    It is distinct from the ``entity`` handling in
    ``schema_overrides.normalize_list_by_user_schema``: that reconciles an
    ``entity`` sub-object *inside list items* and keeps only user-schema keys
    with a conflict override, whereas this promotes a whole sub-object's keys
    to top-level siblings. Do not add a third flattening idiom — extend one of
    these.

    For each key in ``keys`` that maps to a dict in ``resource``, copy its
    entries onto ``resource`` at the top level (without overwriting existing
    top-level values) and drop the original nested key.

    The comparison is asymmetric by design: the function answers "does the
    current state already satisfy what the user asked for?", not "are these
    two values structurally identical". Specifically:

    - For non-empty dict-vs-dict comparisons, ``desired_val`` is treated as a
      partial spec: every key in ``desired_val`` must match the corresponding
      key in ``current_val``, but extra keys present in ``current_val`` (e.g.
      server-injected defaults) are ignored. This avoids spurious patches when
      the API echoes additional fields the user did not specify.
    - An empty ``desired_val`` dict bypasses the subset path and falls back to
      strict equality.
    - ``None`` on the desired side and ``False`` on the desired side with
      ``None`` on the current side are both treated as equal, matching APIs
      that omit booleans when they are ``False``.
